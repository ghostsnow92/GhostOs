# GhostOs
GhostOS is a retro-futuristic web-based desktop environment with a sleek neon theme. It includes apps like Notepad, Calculator, Paint, and Music Player, plus a cool boot animation. Designed for offline use in browsers, it’s lightweight, fast, and perfect for showcasing web UI and development skills.

Currently, the source code and apps are private as the project is still under active development. The full source will be attached here once ready.
